The Gila monster has a very keen sense of smell that it uses for hunting, and can often be seen scenting the air by flicking its tongue in and out of its mouth. The species is near threatened, often killed by humans out of fear, despite the fact it is too slow moving for it to be a serious threat to people.</p>\n",

As generalist predators, the yellow anaconda will feed on most small to medium sized animals that they are able to catch. The species is known for reaching large sizes - adults can reach an average length of 3.3 to 4.4m, as well as an average weight of 25 to 35kg.
